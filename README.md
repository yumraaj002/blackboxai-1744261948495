# Fake News Detection Web App

## Project Overview
The Fake News Detection Web App is a Flask-based web application that allows users to input news articles and receive predictions on whether the news is real or fake. The app utilizes a trained machine learning model to analyze the text and provide confidence scores for the predictions. This project aims to help users discern the credibility of news articles in today's information-rich environment.

## Installation
To get started with the Fake News Detection Web App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv` or any other tool of your choice.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the necessary libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Make sure that you have the correct model files. If the model files (`model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`) are not available, they will be generated when you first run the application.

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can input news text in the provided form, and the application will return the prediction on whether the news is real or fake, along with the confidence level.

## Features
- Input any news article text for analysis.
- Returns a prediction of "Real News" or "Fake News."
- Provides confidence score for the prediction.
- Handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages.
- Simple web interface built with Flask.
